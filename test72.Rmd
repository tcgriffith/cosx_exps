## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
DT::datatable(mtcars, 
              caption= "mtcars",
             extensions = c('FixedColumns',"FixedHeader"),
              options = list(scrollX = TRUE, 
                             paging=FALSE,
                             fixedHeader=TRUE))
```
