Presentation Ninja [with]{.tiny} R and xaringan
================================================================================

In late 2016, Yihui discovered remark.js [@remarkjs] and loved it at the first sight. A few weeks later in the R Markdown ecosystem [@R-rmarkdown], an R package was born and named **xaringan** [@R-xaringan], which nobody knows how to pronounce (including Yihui himself, because it was adapted from the Japanese manga series Naruto by @naruto). Anyway, this package has gained some popularity, and some CSS ninja have started contributing themes to it. One day, Yihui was thinking about creating a gallery for existing themes in **xaringan**. After a few replies in the [Github issue](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/172), he realized there might be enough topics on **xaringan** for a short book. Accidentally, he invented a new development model for writing books: the Github-issue-driven book development.
